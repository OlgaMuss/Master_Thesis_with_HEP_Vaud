        "# Context and Rationale\n",
        "\n",
        "The rapid adoption of generative AI among children and adolescents has created an urgent need to understand how AI-student interactions should be designed for educational settings. While 84% of Swiss 14-19 year-olds report regular AI use [@wipch2025], and 58% of children aged 9-12 use chatbots [@internetmatters2025], these tools were not developed with developmental and pedagogical needs in mind. The risks include cognitive delegation, emotional overreliance, and superficial learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "This thesis is embedded within a broader collaborative project involving HEP Vaud, AI Swiss, everyone.ai, and the Social Brain Sciences Lab at ETH Zurich. The overarching project aims to develop the **SCAFFOLD framework** (Steered Contextual AI Framework for Orchestrating Learning Dialogue) – a methodology to steer LLM behavior for safe and pedagogically appropriate AI-student interactions in education. Previous work has focused on adolescents aged 13-15; this thesis extends the investigation to **10-13 year-olds** (Cycle 2 and early Cycle 3 in Switzerland).\n",
        "\n",
        "The thesis specifically addresses the foundational question: **What are the relevant dimensions of a learning interaction with AI that impact learning outcomes in educational settings?** Before designing effective AI interaction frameworks, we must first understand what interaction elements matter most from both pedagogical and cognitive perspectives."

        "- **Social Learning & Trust:** Affective Social Learning framework [@clement2019affective], which emphasizes the role of emotions and social relationships in knowledge acquisition – children learn not just through cognitive processes but through affective engagement with trusted social partners, making the emotional quality of learning interactions critical\n",
